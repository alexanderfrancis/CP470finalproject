1\. CuddleBug App Report
----------------

### 1.1 Purpose

Countless hours can be spent trying to pick movies and shows that both you and your partner are interested in watching. Scrolling through movie titles and arguing over who gets the final say isn't the ideal way to spend a movie night. Cuddlebug offers a seamless way to choose the best titles for you and your partner, or even your friends!

### 1.2 Scope

-   Have a swiping functionality for users to swipe through movies (liking and disliking them)

-   Have a MyList page that allows users to review their past liked movies

-   Have a friends feature where users can add friends who use the app and compare movie lists

-   Create an all in one platform for browsing movies efficiently displaying all relevant information (Imdb score, description, title, year of release etc.)

-   Written in Java anticipating release on Android OS

### 1.3 Definitions

MyList: Page dedicated to listing liked movies specific to each user account

FriendList: Page dedicated to listing users connected through the application

ExploreMovies: Page dedicated to swiping through movie posters (liking and disliking movies)

CardStack: Visual stacked image representation of movies displayed on main page of application

### 1.5 Overview

CuddleBug is a fun, attractive alternative to movie selection. We aim to acquire an up to date list of relevant films/tv shows available in Canada, design a modern, intuitive GUI for selection and have a user account system in place that permits sharing data between two or more accounts.

This process will help reduce time wasted trying to browse movies/tv shows a user might want to watch at any given time. Instead of taking the time to browse for a title before watching, CuddleBug users will have access to a pre-compiled list of all the movies they want to watch, alongside the movies their friends or partner may want to watch with them.

### 2.2 App Functions

CuddleBug offers the following features:

-   Account authentication through email or google account

-   Viewing all users on the application

-   Adding and removing friends and viewing movies liked in common

-   Viewing movie titles, posters, ratings, descriptions and year of release

-   Liking and disliking movie selections

-   Viewing previously liked movies

### 2.3 User Characteristics

End users consist of a wide variety of demographics, mostly those who are subscribed to streaming services or rent/purchase movies often.

|

Age

 |

Varies anywhere from young adolescents to elderly

 |
|

Gender

 |

Equal use from all genders

 |
|

Language and Culture

 |

Currently English and French are the only languages supported

 |
|

Educational Level

 |

All levels of education. 

 |
|

Frequency of Use

 |

We expect a high frequency of use, specifically concerning the MyList feature

 |
|

Motivation to Use

 |

Motivation depends on each user's movie/tv watching habits. More motivation amongst those who spend more time watching. 

 |

These characteristics do not reflect any data collected during testing. They are only projections of our expected user base as we have yet to publish the app to market. Once published, Google Analytics will provide a detailed report on more specific characteristic details.

### 2.4 Constraints

The CuddleBug experience is constrained by missing features that we look to implement moving forward. Several functionalities including the ability to filter and curate a given user's movie selection based on their preferences and a set of filters. Such a feature would require database manipulation, where custom queries could be sent to our API and processed in a way that returns the specific data requested. From the front end, a dropdown menu or search bar would need to be added so that users can make these requests from their end. Fortunately this was the only deliverable featured from our project proposal which did not make its way to the current application build.

The friends feature is also constrained by the inability to search for specific users by name or email. Currently, users can only add friends from a list that includes all other registered accounts on the app. With an increase in account registration, this will need to be addressed as the list of friends to add will quickly become too large to scroll through. This feature can be implemented by adding additional query options to our friends endpoint such as by name, email or phone number.

Given the time restrictions imposed by our deadlines, the MyList, ExploreMovies and Friends features are implemented in a basic manner to lay the foundation for development moving forward. We hope to better curate movies and improve our apps connectivity in the iterations following this report.
